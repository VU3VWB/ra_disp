# Introduction

This repo hosts some tools for radio astronomy signal processing. This includes both stand-alone tools as well as codes to explore concepts.
There is no guarantee that the codes will work, and eveything here is experimental !

# Hosted codes
As of now, the only code is a dada2spec tool in the psrdada_proc folder, which is under development.
